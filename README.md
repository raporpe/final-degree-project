# Exploring the 802.11 protocol to estimate the degree of occupancy of an area
This repository hosts all my files for my final degree project at Carlos III University.

## Summary

This project aims to estime the amount of people in an area leveraging 802.11 (WiFi) features and machine learning techniques.

The main idea is that WiFi devices (such as mobile phones) are constantly sending information when searching for APs (Access Points) to connect to. This data can be captured by simple devices with a WiFi antenna and then processed to extract information about the number of devices in the area since each device sends a unique identifier (MAC address) and most people have a mobile phone.
